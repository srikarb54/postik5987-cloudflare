</p>

<h2>1. Scope of This Policy</h2>
<p>
<strong>postik5987</strong> is a private automation application created and operated solely by its owner for managing and 
publishing content to the owner’s own business (brands) TikTok accounts.
The App is not offered to the public and does not provide services to external users.

</ul>

<p>
No additional personal information is collected, and no information is collected from external users.

<p>No data is used for advertising, analytics, profiling, or tracking.</p>

<h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>

All authentication credentials and operational data are stored securely using Cloudflare infrastructure, 
including Cloudflare Pages Functions and Cloudflare KV namespaces.
Reasonable technical and organizational safeguards are in place to protect this data from unauthorized access, 
alteration, disclosure, or destruction.
</p>

<h3>4.1 Data Retention</h3>

The App integrates only with TikTok’s official APIs, including the Login Kit and Content Posting APIs.
All data exchanged with TikTok is governed by TikTok’s own privacy policies and developer terms.
